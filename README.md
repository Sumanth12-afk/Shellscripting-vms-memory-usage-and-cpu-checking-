itle: VM Monitoring Script

Description:

This Bash script facilitates the monitoring of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) by gathering essential metrics such as CPU usage, RAM utilization, and disk space. The script iterates through a list of VMs, connecting via SSH to retrieve real-time data. The collected information provides insights into the health and performance of each VM.

Features:

Dynamic VM List: Easily configurable list of VMs, allowing seamless monitoring of numerous instances.

SSH Access: Utilizes SSH to remotely execute commands on each VM, ensuring secure and efficient data retrieval.

Resource Metrics: Monitors CPU usage, RAM utilization, and disk space, offering a comprehensive overview of VM performance.

Usage:

Update the vm_list array with the IP addresses or hostnames of the target VMs.

Execute the script to obtain CPU, RAM, and disk space metrics for each VM.

Review the output to assess the health and resource utilization of the monitored VMs.







This script is an enhanced version that assumes the VMs use the "ubuntu" user for login. It monitors CPU usage, RAM usage, and disk space on a list of VMs using SSH. Here's a corresponding description for your GitHub repository:

Title: Enhanced VM Monitoring Script

Description:

This Bash script is designed for robust monitoring of Virtual Machines (VMs) running on Linux operating systems, assuming the "ubuntu" user for login. The script iterates through a dynamic list of VMs, leveraging SSH to gather critical performance metrics such as CPU usage, RAM utilization, and disk space.

Features:

Dynamic VM List: Easily customizable list of VMs (IP addresses or hostnames) for seamless monitoring of a large-scale environment.

Secure SSH Access: Utilizes SSH with the "ubuntu" user for secure and efficient execution of commands on each VM.

Comprehensive Metrics:

CPU Usage: Monitors real-time CPU usage on each VM.
RAM Usage: Calculates RAM utilization as a percentage of total memory.
Disk Usage: Reports disk space usage on the root file system.
Usage:

Update the vm_list array with the IP addresses or hostnames of the target VMs.

Execute the script to retrieve and display CPU, RAM, and disk space metrics for each VM.

Review the output to assess the health and resource utilization of the monitored VMs.




Title: Secure VM Monitoring Script

Description:

This Bash script is tailored for secure monitoring of Virtual Machines (VMs) running Linux, assuming the "ubuntu" user for login. The script iterates through a list of VMs, each with its corresponding password, using sshpass for automated password input. It retrieves essential performance metrics, including CPU usage, RAM utilization, and disk space.

Features:

Dynamic VM List with Passwords: Easily configurable list of VMs with associated passwords, enhancing security and automation.

Secure SSH Access: Utilizes sshpass to securely automate password input for SSH connections to each VM.

Comprehensive Metrics:

CPU Usage: Monitors real-time CPU usage on each VM.
RAM Usage: Calculates RAM utilization as a percentage of total memory.
Disk Usage: Reports disk space usage on the root file system.
Usage:

Update the vm_passwords associative array with the VMs and their corresponding passwords.

Execute the script to securely retrieve and display CPU, RAM, and disk space metrics for each VM.

Review the output to assess the health and resource utilization of the monitored VMs.

Security Note:

Be cautious about handling and storing passwords in scripts. Consider using more secure alternatives, such as SSH keys, whenever possible.




The provided script is an advanced version that not only monitors VMs but also sends email notifications with the obtained metrics. Here's a GitHub repository description for this script:
